    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In structural biology, we often analyze large numbers of atomic distances in\n",
    "protein structures. A key task is identifying potential hydrogen bonds between\n",
    "atoms, as these bonds play a crucial role in stabilizing protein structures and\n",
    "determining their biological function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hydrogen bond is a relatively weak attraction that can form between atoms\n",
    "under specific conditions. We'll cover the chemistry of hydrogen bonds in detail\n",
    "later in the course, but for this assignment, we'll use a simplified definition:\n",
    "we'll consider a hydrogen bond to potentially exist between any two atoms that\n",
    "are between 2.5 and 3.5 Angstroms (Å) apart. Note that this is a greatly\n",
    "simplified definition; real hydrogen bonds have additional geometric and\n",
    "chemical requirements that we're ignoring for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "(An Angstrom, written as Å, is a unit of length equal to 0.1 nanometers or\n",
    "10^-10 meters. It's commonly used for atomic-scale measurements because it's\n",
    "conveniently sized; most atomic bonds are 1-2 Å in length.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you'll analyze both serial and parallel implementations of\n",
    "code that processes simulated structural data to identify atom pairs that could\n",
    "form hydrogen bonds based on their distances. The goal is to understand how\n",
    "parallel processing can speed up this type of structural analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This assignment is fairly challenging. Each student should turn in\n",
    "their own work, but please do feel free to work in groups to discuss the\n",
