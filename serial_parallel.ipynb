    "1. If processing 10 million distances takes approximately 0.8 seconds, what\n",

    "```python\n",
    "distances = [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]\n",

    "    print(f\"Distance {d}: {in_range}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `d` is 2.0, `in_range` must be what value?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If this code were to be converted to a parallel implementation, it would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficult to parallelize because each count depends on the previous count\n",
    "- An example of an \"embarrassingly parallel\" problem because the list can be split with no dependencies\n",
    "- Require complex synchronization between processes to maintain count accuracy\n",
    "- Need to process the distances in sorted order\n",

    "4. If you were to change 10000000 to 100 in the data generation loop, what would happen to the execution time?"
